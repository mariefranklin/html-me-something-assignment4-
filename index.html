                 <em> Hi! I am Marie, an educator, programmer, hiker, and solo traveler. Originally from New York City but based in St. Louis, I am on a journey to discover the best food, hikes, and cities around the world.</em>

            <h2>How It All Began</h2>
            <p>Some of my earliest memories center around my family cooking dinners from different cultures while my mom told me about her adventures backpacking through Europe and China in the 80s. As long as I can remember, I have known that I wanted to see and eat as much of the world as I can, and that I wanted to do it alone. There is something exhilerating about solo traveling. The ability to be absolutely selfish and uncompromising in what you want to do and where you want to go is something not many people get to experience.</p>

                <h2>West Coast Road Trip</h2>
                <p>If you had told me that I would have the time of my life living out of a tent with limited access to a shower, I would have called you crazy. In the summer of 2016, I left my cramped NY apartment and headed to the West Coast for a 6 week road trip adventure. </p>

                <h2>The First Solo Adventure</h2>
                <p>The first time I traveled solo was to Italy. I had just left a trip with friends sailing around Croatia and I couldnt help but shake as we headed to the airport to go our separate ways. By the time the plane landed in Rome I felt an overwhelming sense of peace. My heart was no longer racing from fear, but rather the possibility of what this adventure would hold. From there, I spent weeks traveling through Italy, Switzerland, France, Belgium, Netherlands and Denmark. </p>

                <h2>Portugal </h2>
                <p>In the past my trips have prioritized quantity. These journeys were fast paced with the desire to see as much as possible. By the summer of 2019, I decided to fully immerse myself in one country. I saw an article advertizing the Azores, a chain of volcanic islands in the mid-Atlanic, and within a week, the tickets were booked. My travel crew and I visited the island of Sao Miguel and Pico. Sao Miguel is the largest of the Azorian islands and is characterized by hydrangeas lining the roads, scenic overlooks, and geothermal hot springs. We then flew to Pico, named for the looming Mt. Pico, which we were determined to climb. Needing to take advantage of my teacher summer breaks, I continued on solo to "the mainland" of Portugal, visiting Lisbon, Lagos, Coimbra, Tomar, and Porto. </p>

                <h2>Whats Next?</h2>
                <p> Since COVID, I have been focused on exploring my own neighborhood. However, with travel restrictions lifting, I am finally able to dust off my hiking boots and visit Arches National Park. Arches has been on the bucklist since I first spotted the iconic Utah license plate image of Delicate Arch. The plan is to roadtrip from St. Louis, stopping in Colorado to explore Rocky Mountain National Park, before heading to Arches, Canyonlands, and Deadhorse. This camping trip promises sunrise hikes, stargazing, and jaw dropping landscapes.  </p>
